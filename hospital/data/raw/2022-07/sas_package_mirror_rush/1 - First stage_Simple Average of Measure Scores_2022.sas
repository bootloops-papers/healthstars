/*This program is used to calulate the 5 groups(domains) scores for 
  each hospital. 
  The 5 groups(domains) are:
  (1)Mortality  
  (2)Safety of Care
  (3)Readmission 
  (4)Patient Experience 
  (5)Timely and Effective Care
  The 5 groups(domains) scores of each hospitals will be used in program 2 
  to derive the hospital star ratings.
